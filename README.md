# Buffer_calc_code
code for calculating acid/base concentrations for buffers
This code is designed to help calculate the amounts of acid and base to use when making buffers in lab. 
The first function takes inputs of pH, pka of the acid, and the desired buffer concentration. 
The first function returns the neccesary concentrataion of weak acid and conjugate base needed for the desired pH, and buffer concentration.
The second function takes inputs of pH, pka of buffer, buffer concentration, strong acid concentration and total volume of buffer.
The second function is designed to calculate the volume in mL of strong acid needed to create a buffer of a certain pH and concentration.
